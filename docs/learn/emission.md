# Emission

### Where does the emission come from?

Zano (₡ZANO) has a hybrid PoW/PoS consensus algorithm to secure the network and therefore emission is generated from two distinct sources:

Proof of Work (PoW) mining. PoW mining creates new ₡ZANO coins to reward miners for completing the calculation and therefore contributing to the network. 100% of the block reward goes to miners.

Proof of Stake (PoS) staking. PoS staking also creates new ₡ZANO coins to reward stakers for staking their funds and therefore contributing to the network.. 100% of the block reward goes to stakers.

### Emission specifications

Emission |	
--- | ---
Block Time | 1 minute
Block Reward |	1 ₡ZANO
Maximum Supply | ∞ (uncapped)
Fee on TXs (flat fee) | 0.01 ₡ZANO

### Emission motivation

Zano made the decision to set the block reward relatively low to avoid unnecessary selling price pressure while keeping the chain safe from TX flood. The block reward is fixed at 1 ₡ZANO per block. We have an uncapped max supply because the assumption that TX flow and its fees would be enough to cover miners' appetite might not be accurate and Bitcoin might become a sad example of this. Having a fixed and slow emission (backed by strong consensus algo) looks like a more safe choice to us.

Zano total supply increases slightly over time while the inflation percentage decreases sligthly over time which can be seen below.

Date | Total Supply (₡ZANO) | Increasement of total supply compared to the year before
--- | --- | ---
01-01-2023 | 13,530,567 | ~4,04%
01-01-2024 | 14,056,167 |	~3,88%
01-01-2025 | 14,581,767 | ~3,74%
01-01-2026 | 15,107,367 |	~3,60%
01-01-2027 | 15,632,967 | ~3,48%
01-01-2028 | 16,158,567 |	~3,36%
01-01-2029 | 16,684,167 | ~3,25%
01-01-2030 | 17,209,767 |	~3,15%
01-01-2031 | 17,735,367 | ~3,05%
01-01-2032 | 18,260,967 | ~2,96%
01-01-2033 | 18,786,567 |	~2,88%

The chart below visually displays the emission (shown in blue) of the number of coins (on the vertical access) and the time duration (in 6 month timestamps) of the total supply.

### Why was there a coinswap with Boolberry?

The Zano project is a technological evolution of the Boolberry (₡BBR) project, a previous project of the Zano team. However, at the same time, the project has different emission curve and premine. To not screw over holders of Boolberry (₡BBR) we decided that it would be fair to give ₡BBR holders a choice: they were able to join in on the new model by participating in the coinswap and exchanging their ₡BBR to ₡ZANO, or they were welcome to keep their stake in BBR (which will continue to be supported).

The coinSwap resulted in 7.8M swapped coins. The remaining ~6M of the initial supply were burned the day after the end of coinswap (proof link): https://explorer.zano.org/transaction/4d4ff1cf20fd18cc72eb88e36da5430498d343bcd21122de5b0ba2d324944722
