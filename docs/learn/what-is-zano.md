# What is Zano

Zano is an open-source cryptocurrency (layer-1) and ecosystem with enterprise-grade privacy, security, and scalability that operates as a robust foundation for confidential assets and decentralized applications (dApps). In short, people can build all kinds of privacy-focused dApps on Zano utilizing our unique features such as Confidential Assets, Escrow Contracts, Aliases, and more.

On Zano everything is private by default, meaning people can’t see the amount transacted, the addresses involved, and not even the asset type transacted.

As illustrated in the image below, all you can see is that a transaction happened. Transactions are verifiable for the sender/receiver through transaction ID’s.

### Technologies

Zano’s lead developer Andrey Sabelnikov created the first-ever privacy coin protocol code base named CryptoNote. Today, this protocol is used by Monero and hundreds of other projects.

Zano is the advanced evolution of Cryptonote, emphasizing unparalleled privacy and adopting a wide variety of technologies that can be used to create all kinds of privacy-focused decentralized applications (dApps) and other projects.

Here are they summed up:

**Zarcanum**: A hallmark of Zano, introducing the world's first hidden amounts Proof of Stake scheme, shaping a novel benchmark in blockchain consensus.

**Confidential Assets**: Beyond the Zano coin, our platform enables user-creatable privacy tokens that possess all the features and functionalities of the native coin, ensuring complete transactional privacy.

**Ionic Swaps**: In Zano's ecosystem, users can smoothly trade between different crypto assets, all while maintaining the essence of privacy.

**Hybrid PoW/PoS Consensus**: By uniting the strengths of both Proof of Work and Proof of Stake processes, Zano delivers enhanced security, curbing double-spend vulnerabilities.

**Auditable Wallets:** An opt-in feature that enables people and organizations to create transparent wallets for situations where we would rather verify than trust. Creating auditable wallets doesn’t affect the privacy of the Zano network in any way.

**Core Performance**: Zano's asynchronous core is a testament to computational efficiency, ensuring forward/backward compatibility and a modular approach ready for the crypto realm's challenges.

Additionally, with features like the dynamic [Marketplace API](https://docs.zano.org/docs/build/marketplace/marketplace-api-guide), adaptable [Escrow/P2P Contracts](https://docs.zano.org/docs/use/escrow-contracts/), and an array of projects nurtured on Zano's foundation, our platform offers diverse opportunities for developers, traders, and all who value privacy in the digital age.
