# Building with Zano

Welcome to the "Build with Zano" page â€” your key resource to initiate and develop projects on the Zano platform. As we relentlessly advance the frontiers of digital privacy, we're here to provide you with the tools and insights necessary to ensure your project not only stands out but also integrates seamlessly with the Zano ecosystem.

Kickstart your journey with our RPC API Guide. Here, you'll gain a comprehensive understanding from the [Overview](rpc-api/overview.md), and delve deeper into the specifics of [How to call the API](rpc-api/how-to-call-api.md). Whether your focus is on the [Daemon RPC API](rpc-api/daemon-rpc-api/get_alias_by_address.md) or the [Wallet RPC API](rpc-api/wallet-rpc-api/atomics_check_htlc_redeemed.md), our guide ensures clarity at every step.

If launching your own project centered around private transactions is your goal, our Confidential Assets section provides a clear [Overview](confidential-assets/overview) along with detailed Methods to give your initiative a solid foundation.
