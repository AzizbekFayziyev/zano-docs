### Asset Creation Example

To deploy a new asset on the Zano blockchain, you need to prepare a JSON-formatted file with asset parameters. Hereâ€™s an example:

```
{
  "ticker": "CT",
  "full_name": "Confidential token",
  "total_max_supply": 100000000000000000,
  "current_supply": 1000000000000000,
  "decimal_point": 12,
  "meta_info": ""
}
```

Then run the following command specifying the route to the file:

```
deploy_new_asset <asset specs file location>
```

You should see a confirmation message upon successful execution
