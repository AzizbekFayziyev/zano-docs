Saves wallet update progress into a wallet file. Although progress is always saved upon graceful wallet application termination, with this call a user can manually trigger saving process. Otherwise, in a case of abnormal wallet application termination the progress wonâ€™t be saved and it will take some time to synchronize on the next launch.
