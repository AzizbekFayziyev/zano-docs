4. Open to your browser and install the Zano Companion extension from the Chrome Web Store. [\[Here\]](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/zano-companion/akcgnllhhhkcpmlenfpicmcpgfpindlb)

5. Click on the extension, and paste the secret you copied in the appropiate field, as well as the password that you will use to login into the Companion.

6. You can now register an [alias](https://app.dhub.dev/c/goncativas-projects/zano-docs/docs/use/aliases.md) if you haven't done so already, this will be displayed as your identity when using the Zano ecosystem.
