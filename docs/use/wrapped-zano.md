# Wrapped Zano

Wrapped Zano (WZANO) is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain that can be swapped 1:1 for ZANO.

It allows us access to the enormous existing infrastructure that exists around Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens, such as [Verse DEX](https://verse.bitcoin.com/swap/).

## How to wrap ZANO

The process of swapping ZANO to WZANO is referred to as “wrapping”. You can wrap ZANO from within any of the Zano mobile or desktop clients. Just go to the “Send” tab, enter the amount of ZANO you would like to receive and the Ethereum address to which you’d like the WZANO to be sent. You will be informed of how much Zano is required to cover the transaction fees before you finalize the transaction.

## How to unwrap WZANO

Go to [https://wrapped.zano.org/app/](https://wrapped.zano.org/app/) connect your metamask wallet and specify the Zano address to which you want to receive ZANO. After that, you will be able to unwrap WZANO to ZANO. The process takes around 15 minutes and you will receive ZANO to your Zano address.
